# OpenGrantStack

OpenGrantStack is an open, modular platform for modern grant infrastructure.

We build tools, standards, and governance systems that make grants easier to manage, easier to audit, and harder to misuse — without locking organizations into opaque vendors or fragile workflows.

This ecosystem is designed for:
- Nonprofits
- Government agencies
- Foundations and funders
- Auditors and compliance teams
- Developers building grant-enabled platforms

Our philosophy is simple: **grants should be transparent, auditable, and composable by default.**

## 🌍 What We’re Building

OpenGrantStack is not a single application.  
It’s a stack — independent components that work alone, but become powerful together.

### Core Pillars

**Grant Operations**
- Application workflows
- Compliance enforcement
- Collaboration and approvals
- Mobile-first access

**Transparency & Trust**
- Immutable audit trails
- Blockchain-based ledgers
- Grant-specific crypto wallets
- Evidence-backed compliance

**Analytics & Impact**
- Progress tracking
- Outcome measurement
- Funder-ready reporting
- Impact metrics

**Governance as Code**
- Compliance enforced via CI
- Policy-driven workflows
- GitHub App–based control plane
- Audit exports on demand

## 🧠 Design Principles

We build with the following principles in mind:

- **Open by default**  
  Standards, schemas, and documentation should be inspectable and reusable.

- **Modular, not monolithic**  
  Organizations should adopt what they need without rewriting everything.

- **Audit-first thinking**  
  Compliance and oversight are features, not afterthoughts.

- **Mobile-native**  
  Grant work happens in the real world, not just behind desks.

- **Human accountability**  
  Automation assists — it does not replace human responsibility.

## 🔐 Licensing & Usage

OpenGrantStack uses a mix of:
- Apache 2.0 licensed open-source components
- Source-available or commercial licenses for managed services and governance tooling

Each repository clearly states its license and intended usage model.

---

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributors who care about:
- Open infrastructure
- Public-sector technology
- Transparency and accountability
- Real-world impact

See individual repositories for contribution guidelines and code of conduct.

## 🚀 Why OpenGrantStack Exists

Grants move billions of dollars every year — yet the systems behind them are often fragmented, opaque, and outdated.

OpenGrantStack exists to change that.

We believe grant infrastructure should be:
- Trustworthy
- Verifiable
- Interoperable
- Built to last

This is infrastructure for the long game.
