🌐 OpenGrantStack

Open infrastructure for transparent, auditable, community‑driven grantmaking.

OpenGrantStack is a modular, open‑source platform designed to modernize how grants are created, reviewed, awarded, and audited.  
We combine secure automation, transparent governance, contributor analytics, and open standards to empower organizations, funders, and communities to collaborate with confidence.

Our mission is simple:  
Make grantmaking fair, efficient, and radically transparent — for everyone.

🚀 What We’re Building

OpenGrantStack is a full ecosystem of interoperable services, including:

- Webhook Receiver — Secure GitHub App event ingestion  
- Contribution Ledger — Immutable, audit‑ready contribution tracking  
- GrantReady SaaS — Front‑end for applicants, reviewers, and admins  
- GrantReady Cloud — Backend workflows, storage, and document processing  
- GrantReady Hub — Analytics, dashboards, and governance insights  
- Integrations Service — Email, Slack, Discord, signing, and external APIs  
- Design System — Unified UI components and accessibility foundations  
- SDKs (Python + JS) — Developer‑friendly interfaces for automation  
- CLI — Tools for contributors, maintainers, and grant teams  
- Governance & Compliance — Policies, ethics, risk, and operational standards  
- Docs Site — Public documentation, onboarding, and architecture guides  

This ecosystem is designed for scalability, auditability, and long‑term sustainability.

🧱 Our Architecture Philosophy

OpenGrantStack is built on five core principles:

1. Transparency by Default
Every contribution, workflow, and decision is traceable and auditable.

2. Modular by Design
Each service is independent, replaceable, and easy to integrate.

3. Governance‑First
Policies, ethics, and compliance are first‑class citizens — not afterthoughts.

4. Developer‑Friendly
SDKs, examples, templates, and automation make adoption frictionless.

5. Community‑Driven
Open source is not a license — it’s a governance model.

This is the architecture of a real open-source platform, not just a codebase.

It gives you:

- Governance clarity  
- Contributor scalability  
- Enterprise trust  
- Developer adoption  
- Future-proof modularity  

And it positions OpenGrantStack as the open-source standard for grantmaking infrastructure.

---

If you want, I can now generate:
- The README.md for all 27 repos  
- The file structure for each  
- The architecture diagrams  
- The governance docs  
- The contributor onboarding system  
- The OpenGrantStack brand system  
- The public website structure  

Just tell me which direction you want to go next.




Perfect — Enterprise‑grade unified architecture it is.  
This is the level where OpenGrantStack stops being “a collection of repos” and becomes a platform with predictable, auditable, scalable structure across every component.

Below is the full file structure for all 27 repositories, each following the same enterprise‑grade pattern, but tailored to the repo’s purpose.

I’ll keep everything clean, consistent, and ready for real-world use.

⭐ Unified Enterprise File Structure Pattern (applies to all repos)

Every repo follows this baseline:

`
/
├── src/                     # Source code
├── tests/                   # Unit + integration tests
├── docs/                    # Architecture, structure, API docs
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/           # CI/CD pipelines
├── scripts/                 # Dev scripts, tooling
├── infra/                   # IaC for repo-specific resources
├── configs/                 # Config files, schemas, settings
├── examples/                # Example usage (SDKs, APIs, CLI)
│
├── CONTRIBUTING.md
