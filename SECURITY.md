# Security Policy

OpenGrantStack takes security seriously, especially given the compliance-sensitive nature of grant infrastructure.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue:
- Do NOT open a public issue
- Email the maintainers or use GitHub’s private security advisories

We will acknowledge reports promptly and work toward a responsible disclosure.

## Scope

Security policies apply to:
- Core services
- Wallets and ledger components
- GitHub App governance tooling
- APIs and schemas

Thank you for helping keep OpenGrantStack secure.
