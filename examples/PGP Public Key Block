## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy

This repository contains:
- **Documentation templates**: No personal data
- **JSON schemas**: Structure definitions only
- **Example data**: Fictional data for demonstration

When using these resources:
1. Do not include real personal or sensitive data in examples
2. Anonymize all test data
3. Follow organizational data protection policies

### Template Usage Security

When using the provided templates:
1. **Review all content** before use to ensure compliance with your specific requirements
2. **Remove placeholders** before finalizing documents
3. **Validate data inputs** when using automated template generation
4. **Secure document storage** for completed templates containing sensitive information

### Schema Validation Security

When implementing schema validation:
1. **Limit recursion depth** to prevent denial of service attacks
2. **Validate payload size** before processing
3. **Use secure JSON parsers** with appropriate limits
4. **Implement input sanitization** for user-provided data

### Dependencies

We regularly monitor and update dependencies for security vulnerabilities:

- **Weekly dependency scanning**: Automated security scans
- **Monthly security reviews**: Manual review of critical dependencies
- **Immediate patching**: Critical vulnerabilities patched within 72 hours

## Security Practices

### Development Practices

1. **Code Review**: All changes require security review
2. **Automated Testing**: Security tests in CI/CD pipeline
3. **Dependency Management**: Regular updates and vulnerability scanning
4. **Secret Management**: No hardcoded secrets in repository

### Access Control

1. **Repository Access**: Limited to core maintainers
2. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Required for all contributors
3. **Audit Logging**: All repository actions logged
4. **Branch Protection**: Main branch requires review and approval

### Incident Response

1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring for security events
2. **Assessment**: Rapid impact assessment
3. **Containment**: Immediate isolation of affected systems
4. **Eradication**: Removal of security threats
5. **Recovery**: Restoration of normal operations
6. **Post-Incident**: Analysis and improvement

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. **Private disclosure**: Initial report handled privately
2. **Timeline coordination**: Agreed timeline for remediation
3. **Public disclosure**: Coordinated public announcement
4. **Credit acknowledgment**: Recognition for security researchers

### Safe Harbor

We consider security research conducted in accordance with this policy to be:
- Authorized conduct
- Exempt from legal action
- Eligible for bug bounty (if applicable)

We will not take legal action against or suspend access to our services for those who:
- Engage in testing of systems/research without harming us or our users
- Engage in vulnerability testing within the scope of our vulnerability disclosure program
- Test on products without affecting users, or receive permission/consent from users before engaging in vulnerability testing against their accounts
- Adhere to the laws of their location and the location of our foundation
- Refrain from disclosing vulnerability details to the public before a mutually agreed-upon timeframe expires

## Security Updates

### Notification Methods

Security updates are communicated through:
1. **GitHub Security Advisories**: For repository-specific issues
2. **Release Notes**: Included in version releases
3. **Security Announcements**: Email notifications for critical issues

### Update Frequency

- **Critical vulnerabilities**: Within 72 hours of discovery
- **High severity**: Within 7 days
- **Medium severity**: Within 30 days
- **Low severity**: Next scheduled release

## Compliance

### Regulatory Frameworks

Our security practices align with:
